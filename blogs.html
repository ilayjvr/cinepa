            <h2>Humanization of the Monster</h2>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>Heartbreaking than horrifying. Compared to earlier film adaptations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein" target="_blank">Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro" target="_blank">Guillermo del Toro</a> was the first to portray the creature as a mosaic of yearning and brokenness, giving it a profoundly humane quality. Del Toro once again applies his signature approach in shaping the creature's design for the viewer, reflecting his unique ability to find beauty in the grotesque, a talent vividly showcased in his previous works, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Peak" target="_blank">Crimson Peak</a>.</p>
                
                <p>While monsters are traditionally meant to horrify viewers, the lasting impression of the creature in del Toro's Frankenstein is quite the opposite. The character development of the creature is tragically beautiful, making you ask: how can a being with broken skin be so pure inside that it makes you cry and makes you truly feel for it? Horror movies were meant to make you want to close your eyes to avoid gore, not to close them out of empathy for the monster.</p>
                
                <p>The creature's first word was "Victor", which earned disdain from his creator, Victor Frankenstein. At the beginning of the movie, his inability to say words but "Victor" was framed as the reflection of his cognitive incapacity, seemingly signaling to the audience that there has been an error in its creation. His creator called him "it", diminishing his chance to be recognized as human. The perspective of this so-called error shifts when Elizabeth meets the creature; a lost soul trying to fathom a soulless being.</p>
                
                <p>"Perhaps for the time being it means everything to him" a mind twisting line of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Lavenza" target="_blank">Elizabeth</a> trying to understand how the creature makes sense of the only word it can tell. This scene tells so much about the creature, that perhaps it behaves in such a way because it lacks knowledge, yet one thing's certain: it can feel. This makes the viewers question, if the creature can feel longing to be human, can feel rage and can even forgive, isn't that enough to call it human? How much does it cost to truly earn the title HIM?</p>
                
                <p>"I found what I am. What I'm made from. I am the child of a charnel house. A wreckage, assembled from refuse and discarded dead. A monster." - the creature. The movie ends without it finding the answer to its heartbreaking question: of all the souls it was made of, which of it has the greatest part that it can call HIS? The creature's brokenness seen in its appearance and inner ruin, humanize it in the eyes of the viewers, evoking sympathy and recognition of its profound struggle.</p>
